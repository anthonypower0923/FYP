### Detection Script Usage

To run the current example version of the detection script you will require the 'merged_output.pcap'. This file could not be uploaded to the repo as it was too large, so to get this file go to this page on GitHub from GreyNoise https://github.com/GreyNoise-Intelligence/2024-09-noise-storms/tree/main/noise-storm-icmp-brazil, click into the icmp sample and in the README should be instruction on how to obtain this merged packet capture file.
